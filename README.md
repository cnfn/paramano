The official trayfreq (see AUTHORS) was abandoned and stopped working with modern systems. This is a fork which is designed to work on newer Archlinux systems, however it shouldn't be limited to Arch.

Check out the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Trayfreq) for more info about this software.
