To set the frequency or governor of the CPU, you must have root
permissions.  To avoid having to run trayfreq as root since it
constantly runs, when you install, the SUID bit of trayfreq-set is
changed so that it is ran as root without needing a password.  To
disable this, append --disable-setsuid when running ./configure
and run trayfreq as root.
